# Homemade-kNN-Classifier

In this k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier , to a point the algorithm identifies some of its closest neighbours and then predict the class label corresponding to that point. This 'Homemade' Classifier is then compared to Scikit classifier to calculate its accuracy to predict the class of a point. To compare its prediction accuracy with Scikit classifier both the SciKitLearn and the homemade classifier is applied to a classic data set created by Ron Fisher in 1933.
